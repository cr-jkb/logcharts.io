LogCharts is a tool for viewing the logs generated by [HWInfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/), a hardware monitoring program.

From the log, a line chart is generated. It is possible to see individual values on the line with the tooltip, in addition to viewing smaller sections of the log on the line chart through a feature called "brushing".

It is possible to change the chart according to each field available in the log, for example, the CPU temperature, the percentage of RAM usage and the activity of the storage devices, among others. You can add multiple lines of different colors to view multiple data at the same time. This can be useful, for example, to understand the behavior of the CPU temperature in relation to the voltage variation, the fan RPM and any other data present in the log, further deepening the analysis.

By interpreting the HWInfo logs in a more intuitive way, you can have a better idea of how your computer is working, which allows you to identify problems and find solutions more easily.
