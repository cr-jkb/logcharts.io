LogCharts is a tool for viewing the logs generated by [HWInfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/), a hardware monitoring program.

From the log, a line chart is generated. It is possible to see individual values on the line with the tooltip, in addition to viewing smaller sections of the log on the line chart through a feature called "brushing".

It is possible to change the chart according to each field available in the log, for example, the CPU temperature, the percentage of RAM usage and the activity of the storage devices, among others.
